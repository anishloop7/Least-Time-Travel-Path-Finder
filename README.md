# Least-Time-Travel-Path-Finder
Using Dijkstra's Algorithm, we can find the shortest path between nodes in a graph. Particularly, we can find the shortest path from a node (called the "source node") to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.

This algorithm is used in GPS devices to find the shortest path between the current location and the destination.
In this project it is a small demonstration to find least time travel path between two city.
